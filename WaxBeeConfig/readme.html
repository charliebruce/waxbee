<p>Home site: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/waxbee/">http://code.google.com/p/waxbee/</a>

<h2>To Install</h2>
Just unzip the package somewhere handy.

Make sure you have a Java 1.6 (or more recent) installed on your system.

<h2>To Run<h2>
To run wither double-click the <b>waxbee.jar</b> file or invoke it on the command line with

javaw -jar waxbee.jar

<h2>Teensy Loader</h2>

The tool has a "teensy loader" built-in that will recognize the Teensy through the USB port. 

Alternatively, the Teensy Loader software may be used to upload a .hex file generated by this tool.

The configuration utility has only been tested on Windows 7, 64bit. Since this is mostly a java application, most of the functionality will work anywhere. As of this writing the Teensy loader only works on Windows 64 bits.

<h2>Guide</h2>

Select "New from Template" and pick a template that matches your serial (or adb) tablet. 

<h3>No suitable template</h3>
If not in the list, pick one of a similar series.  (like pick a UD-* for a UD-* tablet). You will then have to tweak the settings (the max coordinates comes to mind). There are few ways to discover this. You may ask the question on the forum. forum.bongofish.co.uk
